# Softwrap
Dynamics for retopology.

This is an alpha version, probably full of bugs, use at your own risk.

# considerations before using:
 * This is a slow addon, decimate your sculpt before using it
 * Make sure your models are roughly the same scale and aligned to make transfer easier.
 * You can use proportional or sculpt to make models more similar in case there's a big shape discrepancy
 * Dont swap Target Mesh and Source Mesh, Target is your sculpt, Source is your quads mesh.

# instalation
 * Click clone or download
 * select download zip
 * open blender user preferences
 * open addons tab
 * hit install
 * select the downloaded zip file
 * enable the addon.
